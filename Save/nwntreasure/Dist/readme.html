<h3 align="left">1. Introduction</h3>
<p align="left">NWN Treasure Editor (NWN Treasure) provides the content creator
with the ability to easily customize and augment the existing treasure tables
provided by Bioware.&nbsp; It is a standalone application that produces NSS (NWN
script source) files that are compiled by the existing NWN toolset.</p>
<p align="left">If desired by the content provider, NWN Treasure editor will
produce what is called &quot;Shroudworld&quot; style treasure tables.&nbsp;
These advanced treasure tables provide automatic respawning of treasure chests,
NPCs, and a few more advanced features.</p>

<h3 align="left">2. About Tables</h3>
<h4 align="left">What are Treasure/Encounter/Placeable Tables?</h4>
<p align="left">There are 3 types of tables in the NWN treasure editor
program.&nbsp; Each type is used to spawn a specific item.&nbsp; All act exactly
the same.</p>
<p align="left">Tables are a road map to the creation of content.&nbsp; They tell what
content to create.&nbsp; For example, a treasure table for a lowly goblin might include 1-6
gold pieces and a twenty percent chance of dropping a loaf of bread.&nbsp;
Simple, right?&nbsp; Well, in reality, it is a bit more complicated.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Supplied with this program is a file called &quot;nwn_default.xml&quot;.&nbsp;
It contains treasure tables that emulate the treasure tables contained within
NWN.&nbsp; It contains exactly 511 different treasure tables.&nbsp; Most of
these treasure tables are only used internally.&nbsp; But it still underscores
how complex treasure tables can be.&nbsp; Also supplied with this program is
&quot;nwtreas_demo.xml&quot;.&nbsp; It is a copy of &quot;nwn_default.xml&quot;
with the addition of a new treasure table used by the &quot;nwtreas_demo&quot;
module.&nbsp; Finally, there is &quot;respawn_demo.xml&quot; that contains
sample placeable and encounter tables.</p>
<p align="left">To understand exactly what a table is, let us compare
it to a real life game that two friends might play.&nbsp; We will call these two
friends Moe and Larry.&nbsp; Moe takes a deck of 3x5 index cards.&nbsp; On the
top of each index card, he writes something for Larry to do or to look for (we will
call this the &quot;decision&quot;).&nbsp; This could be flip a coin or see if
there is a red car close by.&nbsp; The rest of the card is filled with commands
that Larry will have to do depending on the results from what was written at the
top of the card (we will call these the actions).&nbsp; These could be things
such as &quot;go home, game over&quot; or &quot;buy some gum&quot;.&nbsp; Now to
make this game a little bit more interesting, the card could also tell Larry to
go in search of another card that will give his more tasks to do.</p>
<p align="left">So after a day of preparation, Moe calls Larry up and tells him,
&quot;I have placed 50 index cards at different location in the city.&nbsp; I
want you to start by going to the General Store at the corner of Lexington and
Main and ask the manager for the card.&quot;&nbsp; So Larry gets in his car and
drives to the store and asks the manager for the card.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">On the top of the card is written &quot;Decision: Look at the
people in the checkout lines and depending what you see, perform only one of the
following actions.&quot;&nbsp; The actions are as follow:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p align="left">If you see a woman with a child, then head over to the drug
    store on 10th street and ask the manager for your next card.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">If you see a shopping cart with a broken wheel, then head
    over to the playground on Washington Ave. There you will find a card taped
    to the bottom of the slide.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">If you didn't see either of those, get the dollar I gave to
    the manager, buy yourself a candy bar and go home.&nbsp; The game is over.</li>
</ol>
<p align="left">Even though Larry didn't see a woman with a child, he did see a
shopping cart with a broken wheel.&nbsp; So he jumps into his car and heads to
the playground.&nbsp; There he finds another card in a zip lock bag with a 6
sided die.&nbsp; Written on the card is &quot;Decision: Roll the die and perform
only one of the following actions.&quot;&nbsp; The actions are as follow:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p align="left">If you roll a 1 or a 2, then head on over to the Mazda
    dealership 3 blocks down the road.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">If you roll a 3, 4, or 5 then look under the 3rd swing seat
    and you will find 10 dollars.&nbsp; Take it and go home.&nbsp; Game over.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">If you roll a 6, you lose, go home.</li>
</ol>
<p align="left">Luckily for Larry, he rolls a 4 and ends the game 10 dollars
richer.</p>
<p align="left"><i>So how does this compare with tables?</i></p>
<p align="left">Tables work the exact same way.&nbsp; Instead of an
index card, we have a table.&nbsp; Instead of Moe, the content creator
makes the tables.&nbsp; Instead of Larry, we have the script file executing the
tables and creating the content.</p>
<h4 align="left">Decisions and Actions</h4>
<p align="left">With tables, everything is based on decisions and
actions.&nbsp; Every table has exactly one decision and zero or more
actions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">The types of decisions are as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Pick One Of - Given a list of actions, randomly pick one</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Pick Multiple From - Given a list of actions, pick an action based on a percentage chance.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Pick By Racial Type - Pick an action based on the race of a
    creature, NPC, or PC</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Pick By Level Range - Pick an action based on the level of
    the creature, NPC, or PC</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Pick By Class - Pick an action based on if the creature,
    NPC, or PC is of a given class</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Pick By Random Class - Pick an action based on a random
    choice between all 3 classes the creature, NPC or PC might possess.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Pick By Armor Proficiency - Pick an action based on if the
    creature, NPC, or PC is proficient in a weight of armor.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Pick By Weapon Focus - Pick an action based on if the
    creature, NPC, or PC is focused on a given weapon class.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Pick By Specific - Picks an action based on if a previous
    entry in the table requested that class specific treasure be
    generated.&nbsp; Otherwise, class generic treasure is generated.&nbsp; This
    is primarily used by the boss creature spawns.</li>
</ol>
<p align="left">The types of decisions supported by NWN Treasure was primarily
dictated by what was required to emulate Bioware's existing tables.</p>
<p align="left">The types of actions are as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Drop nothing, stop creating treasure</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Drop Gold</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Drop an Item</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Move to Table</li>
</ol>
<p align="left">With each type of action, the content creator must specify
specifics about the treasure to be created.&nbsp; For example, in the case of an
item, the blueprint name, and the number of items to create must be
specified.&nbsp; For gold, the dice used to generate the amount of gold has to
be specified.&nbsp; However, common to all actions, a single parameter that is
specific to the decision being used must be specified.&nbsp; This tells the
treasure generator under what circumstances this action is to be executed.&nbsp;
For example, in the case of &quot;Pick By Racial Type&quot;, the specific
parameter might be &quot;Human&quot; or &quot;Gnome&quot;.</p>
<h4 align="left">Decisions in Depth</h4>
<h5 align="left">&quot;Pick One Of&quot;</h5>
<p align="left">(Valid with: treasure tables, encounter tables, and placeable
tables)</p>
<p align="left">When using the &quot;Pick One Of&quot; decision, a single random
number is generated. That random number is used to decide which action is to be
taken.&nbsp; It is important to remember, that with this decision, only one
action will be taken.&nbsp; To provide more flexibility than each action having
an equal chance of being chosen, each action is allowed to specify a
&quot;chance&quot;.&nbsp; This is a number between 0 and 9999.&nbsp; Prior to
the random number being generated, the sum of all the chances for every action
in the table is computed.&nbsp; Then the random number is generated
and an action is chosen.</p>
<p align="left">Example:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Chance 5: Create Gold</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Chance 1: Create &quot;Uber&quot; Item</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Chance 4: Do nothing</li>
</ol>
<p align="left">In this example, we have 3 actions.&nbsp; Each action has a
chance assigned to it.&nbsp; The total of all the chances is 10.&nbsp; So, then
a random number between 0 and 9 would be generated.&nbsp; If the number is 0-4,
then gold is created.&nbsp; If the number is 5, then the &quot;Uber&quot; item
is created.&nbsp; If the number is 6-9, then nothing is created.</p>
<p align="left">Note: You are allowed to assign a chance of 0 to an
action.&nbsp; You can see an example of this in the Bioware treasure
tables.&nbsp; Initially, Bioware would generate random animal
parts.&nbsp; In either March or May, it was decided that animal parts were just
&quot;too silly&quot; and their chance was set to zero.&nbsp; In strange homage
to Bioware and the old &quot;that's just plain silly&quot; Month Python sketch,
I have left in the animal parts treasure table with the chance set to 0.</p>
<h5 align="left">&quot;Pick Multiple From&quot;</h5>
<p align="left">(Valid with: treasure tables, encounter tables, and placeable
tables)</p>
<p align="left">The &quot;Pick One Of&quot; decision can be though of &quot;Pick
this or that&quot;.&nbsp; In the case of &quot;Pick Multiple From&quot;, we have
&quot;Pick this, maybe.&nbsp; Oh and that too, maybe.&nbsp; Oh yes, and one of
those, sort of.&quot;&nbsp; For each action, a random number is generated
between 0 and 99.&nbsp; If the random number is less than the percent chance assigned
to each action then that action is done.&nbsp; Each action is allowed to set a
percent chance from 0 to 100.&nbsp; If the action has a percent chance of 0,
then the action will never get taken.&nbsp; If the action has a percent chance
of 100, it will always be taken.</p>
<p align="left">Example:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Percent Chance 100: Create Gold</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Percent Chance 30: Create &quot;Uber&quot; Item</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Percent Chance 0: Create Animal Parts</li>
</ol>
<p align="left">In this example, we have 3 actions.&nbsp; The first action has a
percentage chance of 100.&nbsp; It will always create gold.&nbsp; Then the
next action is checked.&nbsp; If the random number generated is 0-29, then the
&quot;Uber&quot; item is created.&nbsp; If the random number is 30-99, then the
&quot;Uber&quot; item isn't created.&nbsp; Finally, since the &quot;Animal
Parts&quot; has a 0 percent chance, then it will never get tested.&nbsp; A new
random number is generated for each action.</p>
<p align="left">Note: It is important to remember that EACH action will be
checked.&nbsp; Thus each action has a chance of being taken.</p>
<h5 align="left">&quot;Pick By Racial Type&quot;</h5>
<p align="left">(Valid with: treasure tables)</p>
<p align="left">In Bioware's tables, the racial type was used to weed out
treasure from certain creatures such as animals or undead.&nbsp; The create
who's race is being tested can vary greatly depending on what situation the
treasure is being generated.&nbsp; See the later section on the relatives of
treasure generation.&nbsp; When the actions for a racial type decision are
configured, a race must be specified for each action.&nbsp; You can also select
the race of &quot;Any&quot; as a catch all for the final action.&nbsp; It is
important to remember than any action listed after an action using
&quot;Any&quot; will never get executed.</p>
<p align="left">Example:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Undead: Do nothing</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Animal: Do nothing</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Orc: Go to the special orc treasure tables.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Any: Go to the standard treasure tables.</li>
</ol>
<p align="left">In this example, if our NPC is &quot;Undead&quot; or
&quot;Animal&quot; (we can't be silly now), then no treasure is generated.&nbsp;
If the race is &quot;Orc&quot; then we continue with treasure generation using a
treasure table specific for orcs.&nbsp; Otherwise, our &quot;Any&quot; catches
all other races and executes the standard treasure tables.</p>
<p align="left">If you don't use &quot;Any&quot; at the end of your
table, then if you NPC isn't one of the races listed, then no treasure will be
generated.</p>
<h5 align="left">&quot;Pick By Level Range&quot;</h5>
<p align="left">(Valid with: treasure tables)</p>
<p align="left">&quot;Pick By Level Range&quot; allows the content provider to
scale treasure based on the range of the NPC or characters.&nbsp; Currently, NWN Treasure
uses the same level ranges as used by Bioware.&nbsp; However, a
future enhancement might allow this to be configurable.&nbsp; The level ranges
are as follows 0-5, 6-8, 9-10,11-13,14-16,17-100.&nbsp; Each of these level
ranges are given numbers between 1-6 with 1 being levels 0-5 while 6 is levels
17-100.&nbsp; Each action must specify which level range it applies.&nbsp;
Multiple actions can not be assigned the same level range.&nbsp; Well, they can
be assigned the same range, but only the first one will be utilized.</p>
<p align="left">Example:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Level Range 1: Give them a rock</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Level Range 2: Give them a rusty dagger</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Level Range 3: Give them a clean rusty dagger</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Level Range 4: Give them a rusty dagger that has had the mileage
    rolled back in an attempt to sell it as new.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Level Range 5: Give them a new dagger</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Level Range 6: Give them a new dagger, but one that doesn't
    fall apart on first use.</li>
</ol>
<p align="left">In this example, if the PC was level 12, that
would equate to a level range of 4 and result in a &quot;rusty dagger that has
had...&quot;.</p>
<h5 align="left">&quot;Pick By Class/Random Class&quot;</h5>
<p align="left">(Valid with: treasure tables)</p>
<p align="left">&quot;Pick By Class&quot; and &quot;Pick By Random Class&quot;
allows the content developer to chose treasure based on the class of the NPC or
PC.&nbsp; The way that &quot;Class&quot; and &quot;Random Class&quot; differ is
that with &quot;Class&quot; a character is tested to see if he has that
class.&nbsp; With &quot;Random Class&quot; a random class based on levels from
the 3 available classes of the character is chosen.&nbsp; Then based on that
class, the different actions are selected.&nbsp; Like &quot;Pick By Racial
Type&quot;, this decision has available the catch-all of &quot;any&quot; to send
the NPC or PC to default tables if they don't have the classes being
tested.</p>
<p align="left">Example:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Class FIGHTER: Give them a really big sword</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Class THIEF: Give them a small sword</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Class MONK: Give them a thank-you card and send them on
    their way</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Class Any: Give all other classes 50 gold</li>
</ol>
<p align="left">First, let us take the case of a wizard and this is a &quot;Pick
By Class&quot;.&nbsp; The treasure generator would say, &quot;Is he a fighter?
No. Is he a thief? No.&nbsp; Is he a monk? No.&nbsp; Then give him 50
gold.&nbsp; Now, what if the take the case of a thief with a &quot;Pick By
Class&quot;.&nbsp; In this case, a short sword would be generated.&nbsp; What if
the thief was a level 10 thief and a level 1 fighter and this was a pick by
class?&nbsp; Then a really big sword would be created.&nbsp; A HAH!!!&nbsp; THAT
SUCKS!!!&nbsp; Yes it does.&nbsp; That is why &quot;Pick By Random Class&quot;
exists.&nbsp; Lets take the case of our level 10 thief and level 1 warrior, but
this time, our decision is &quot;Pick By Random Class&quot;.&nbsp; The treasure
generator would look at the PC and see that he is a level 10 thief and a level 1
fighter.&nbsp; Then it would randomize a number between 0 and 10 (total of 11 which is
the total number of hit dice for the character) and depending on the roll, it
picks a class.&nbsp; 10 out of 11 times it will pick thief and 1 out of 11 times
it will pick fighter.&nbsp; Then that randomly chosen class is used to search
the action table.&nbsp; If we randomly chose a thief, the short sword would be
created.&nbsp; Otherwise, the really big sword would be created.</p>
<p align="left">Aside: It is interesting looking at Bioware's tables.&nbsp; They
have a table called &quot;table2&quot;.&nbsp; This table generates special class
specific loot.&nbsp; It uses the random class to generate which class specific
loot to create.&nbsp; However, if you look at the feat tables, it uses just the
existence of a class on the character to make a decision.&nbsp; Admittedly, due
to the way the feat tables are made, few characters will ever have their class
used to generate feat treasure.</p>
<p align="left">Note: Only the first action that matches the decision test will
be executed.</p>
<h5 align="left">&quot;Pick By Armor Proficiency&quot;</h5>
<p align="left">(Valid with: treasure tables)</p>
<p align="left">&quot;Pick By Armor Proficiency&quot; allows to content provider
to pick treasure based on the type of armor the character will probably
ware.&nbsp; It is important that action are listed from heavy to light with the
catch-all of &quot;Any&quot; listed last.&nbsp; This decision was included
primarily for one treasure table in Bioware's treasure tables that needed to
test to see if the ranger could use heavy armor.&nbsp; Rangers that have heavy
armor proficiency use the fighter tables while rangers without use the barbarian
tables.</p>
<p align="left">Note: Only the first action that matches the decision test will
be executed.</p>
<h5 align="left">&quot;Pick By Weapon Focus&quot;</h5>
<p align="left">(Valid with: treasure tables)</p>
<p align="left">&quot;Pick By Weapon Focus&quot; allows the content provider to
pick treasure based on which weapon the PC has decided to focus on.&nbsp;
&quot;Any&quot; is available as a catch-all.</p>
<h5 align="left">&quot;Pick By Specific&quot;</h5>
<p align="left">(Valid with: treasure tables)</p>
<p align="left">&quot;Pick By Specific&quot; is only used in Bioware's class
specific treasure tables.&nbsp; Boss mobs use the specific tables to generate a
better quality of class specific loot.&nbsp; The only two options for the
actions are &quot;Specific&quot; and &quot;Generic&quot;.</p>
<h4 align="left">Actions in Depth</h4>
<h5 align="left">&quot;Drop Nothing/Spawn Nothing&quot;</h5>
<p align="left">(Valid with: treasure tables, encounter tables, and placeable
tables)</p>
<p align="left">When a &quot;Drop Nothing/Spawn Nothing&quot; action is reached then
content generation is stopped for that part of the process.&nbsp;
The only exception is cases where an action has it specified that a
table is used multiple times to generate content.&nbsp; In that case, only that
instance of content generation is stopped.&nbsp; Any remaining iterations will
continue normally.</p>
<h5 align="left">&quot;Drop Gold&quot;</h5>
<p align="left">(Valid with: treasure tables)</p>
<p align="left">&quot;Drop Gold&quot; instructs the treasure generator to create
some gold.&nbsp; Gold creation has 3 parameters, the number of dice, the die
itself and a final multiplier.&nbsp; For example, a &quot;Drop Gold&quot; action
might request 5d20*1.5.&nbsp; This translates into roll a d20 5 times and sum up
all the values.&nbsp; Then multiply the final value by 1.5.</p>
<h5 align="left">&quot;Drop Item&quot;</h5>
<p align="left">(Valid with: treasure tables)</p>
<p align="left">&quot;Drop Item&quot; instructs the treasure generator to create
an item.&nbsp; The blueprint of the item must be specified and MUST match a
blueprint name in NWN or you module.&nbsp; Failure to specify a valid blueprint
name will result in unpredictable results (i.e. the badgers of death).&nbsp; The
number of items to create can also be defined using a range.&nbsp; If a range of
&quot;1-30&quot; is specified, then between 1 and 30 copies of the item will be
generated.&nbsp; The specific value will be randomized.&nbsp; If you specify a
closed range such as &quot;2-2&quot;, then 2 items will always be
generated.&nbsp; At this point, if you specify more than one copy of
non-stackable items, I don't know what will happen.</p>
<h5 align="left">&quot;Spawn Creature/NPC&quot;</h5>
<p align="left">(Valid with: encounter tables)</p>
<p align="left">&quot;Spawn Creature/NPC&quot; will spawn the given creature or
NPC.&nbsp; The blueprint of the creature must be specified and MUST match a
blueprint name in NWN or you module.&nbsp; Failure to specify a valid blueprint
name will result in unpredictable results (i.e. the badgers of death).&nbsp; The
number of creatures to spawn can also be defined using a range.&nbsp; If a range of
&quot;1-30&quot; is specified, then between 1 and 30 copies of the creature will be
generated.&nbsp; The specific value will be randomized.&nbsp; If you specify a
closed range such as &quot;2-2&quot;, then 2 items will always be
generated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h5 align="left">&quot;Spawn Placeable&quot;</h5>
<p align="left">(Valid with: placeable tables)</p>
<p align="left">&quot;Spawn Placeable&quot; will spawn the given
placeable.&nbsp; The blueprint of the creature must be specified and MUST match a
blueprint name in NWN or you module.&nbsp; Failure to specify a valid blueprint
name will result in unpredictable results (i.e. the badgers of death).&nbsp;</p>
<h5 align="left">&quot;Move to Table&quot;</h5>
<p align="left">(Valid with: treasure tables, encounter tables, and placeable
tables)</p>
<p align="left">&quot;Move to Table&quot; allows the content provider to chain
together multiple decisions into one large table.&nbsp; For example, if
you wanted a special table for rangers with heavy armor, then you would
first have to have a table that &quot;Pick By Class&quot; to select all
the rangers, and then a table that &quot;Pick By Armor
Proficiency&quot; to select rangers with heavy armor.</p>
<p align="left">Like &quot;Drop Item&quot;, this action allows you to run the
given table 1 or more times.&nbsp; If one run of the treasure table
runs yields a &quot;Drop Nothing/Spawn Nothing&quot;, then only that iteration will be
stopped.&nbsp; All remaining iterations will continue.</p>
<p align="left">Two other options for this action are available.&nbsp; The first
is &quot;Modifier&quot;.&nbsp; This option allows you to temporarily boost the
level of the character for which treasure is being generated.&nbsp; Thus, any
later decisions using &quot;Pick By Level Range&quot; will use the adjusted
range.&nbsp; Modifiers are not cumulative.&nbsp; If you specify a zero, the
modifier will be reset to zero.&nbsp; Most all actions of this type leave
&quot;Modifier&quot; set to &quot;Inherit&quot;.&nbsp; This option tells the
treasure generator to leave the current modifier unadjusted.</p>
<p align="left">The second option is &quot;Specific&quot;.&nbsp; This option
temporarily tells the treasure generator that any decisions using &quot;Pick By
Specific&quot; should select the value specified.&nbsp; Most all actions of this
type leave &quot;Specific&quot; set to &quot;Inherit&quot;.</p>
<h4 align="left">The Relatives of Treasure Generation</h4>
<p align="left">One very important concept to the treasure generation is for
whom is the treasure being generated.&nbsp; In the case of NPC's, when they
spawn, their treasure is generated relative to themselves.&nbsp; If they are a
rogue, then any special class treasure will be generated for a rogue.&nbsp; In
the case of treasure chests, the player who opened the chest or destroyed the
chest is used to generate the treasure.</p>
<p align="left">For multiplayer games, this is a very important thing to keep in
mind.&nbsp; As is, treasure for chests will be generated primarily for the
&quot;lewt whores&quot; who have to be the first who open the chest.&nbsp;
(Yours truly included.&nbsp; Just ask Amberyll and Deeva.)&nbsp; This problem
will be resolves in a future version of NWN Treasure.</p>

<hr size="1">
<h3 align="left">3. Editing Tables</h3>
<h4 align="left">Creating New Tables</h4>
<p align="left">When you create a new table, you need to specify three
things, the name of the table, the decision to be used, and if the table is
global.</p>
<p align="left">I <b><i><font color="#FF0000">STRONGLY</font> </i></b>suggest
that all new table names are prefixed with something other than &quot;nw_&quot;.&nbsp;
For example, if Segal creates a few treasure tables for everyone to use in
Shroudworld, he will prefix the treasure tables with &quot;sw_&quot;.&nbsp; The
ones he won't share might be prefixed with &quot;swa_&quot;, which is the prefix
for his module.&nbsp; For my module, my treasure tables are prefixed with &quot;mk_&quot;.</p>
<p align="left">The global flag is very important.&nbsp; If a table is
marked as global, then it appears directly below the &quot;<i>XXXX</i> Tables&quot;
entry in the tree.&nbsp; The icon has a small blue circle in the lower right
hand corner.&nbsp; Global tables are always included in the exported script and have callable routines created for them.&nbsp; If you wish
to invoke a table directly from a script, then you MUST mark that table
as global.</p>
<p align="left">In some cases you will see tables in root of the
&quot;<i>XXXX</i> Tables&quot; along with your global tables.&nbsp; However, these
tables have a small yellow question mark in the lower right hand corner of the
icon.&nbsp; These are tables that have been created but are not marked as global
and have not been referenced by any other tables.&nbsp; Non-global, unreferenced
tables will not be included in the exported script.</p>
<h4 align="left">Creating New Actions</h4>
<p align="left">One you have created a new table, you can start to add actions
to the table.&nbsp; Selected the table and then use the &quot;Insert In...&quot;
option to add a new action inside of the selected table.&nbsp; After the first
action has been added, you can select the newly added action and then use
&quot;Insert After..&quot; to create a new action after the selected action.</p>
<p align="left">If your new action is &quot;Move To Table&quot;, you can
selected from an existing table or type the name of a new table.&nbsp; If you do
type in the name of a new table you will be prompted to make sure that you wish
to create a new table.&nbsp; If you do create a new table, the decision for the
table will default to &quot;Pick One Of&quot;.&nbsp; To change this, select the
action you just added and select &quot;Table Properties&quot;.</p>
<p align="left">Note: Once an action has been created, you can not change the
type of action.</p>
<h4 align="left">Modifying Tables</h4>
<p align="left">Modifying table properties can be confusing.&nbsp; Tables in the
root of the tree are easy to modify.&nbsp; However, tables that exist deep
within the tree are more or less hidden.&nbsp; There isn't anything you can
select that says &quot;this is table nw_item_fighter_weapon_s_1&quot;.&nbsp;
However, all &quot;Move To Table&quot; actions have a table associated with
them.&nbsp; So if you want to change the properties of the table and not the
action, select the &quot;Move To Table&quot; action in question and then press
&quot;Table Properties&quot;.&nbsp; This will allow you to change the decision
and global flag settings for that table.</p>
<h4 align="left">Moving Actions</h4>
<p align="left">Actions can not be moved from table to table.&nbsp; However,
their order within a table can be changed.&nbsp; For some decisions, the order is very
important.&nbsp; Any decision that has an &quot;Any&quot; option should always
have the &quot;Any&quot; listed at the end.&nbsp; If you get your actions out of
order, you can select the action you wish to move an then use the Up/Down
commands to move them.</p>

<h3 align="left">4. Using NWN Treasure</h3>
<p align="left">NWN Treasure is really two programs in one.&nbsp; The first
program allows content providers to edit the default NWN treasure tables and
then export a script file that is compatible with Bioware's &quot;nw_o2_coninclude&quot;.&nbsp; The second part of
NWN Treasure is by far much
more powerful.&nbsp; It provides the core scripts for a complete NPC/Placeable
respawn system that will also utilize the treasure tables.</p>
<p align="left">So, before you can continue on, you have to ask yourself, do you
want the full Shroudworld respawn system or do you just want to be able to edit
your treasure tables.</p>
<hr size="1">
<h3 align="left">4.1 Using NWN Treasure Just to Edit Treasure Tables</h3>
<p align="left">So, you have decided that all you want to do is create new
treasure tables.&nbsp; Well, you still have one question to answer, do you want
to use these new treasure tables for ALL your NPCs and treasure chests or just
to new NPCs and treasure chests.</p>
<p align="left"><u><i><b><font color="#FF0000">WARNING:</font></b></i></u> Under
NO circumstances should you EVER overwrite the scripts contained in NWN's
override directory.&nbsp; Don't do it.&nbsp; JUST DON'T DO IT.</p>
<p align="left"><u><i><b><font color="#FF0000">WARNING:</font></b></i></u>  When
exporting scripts, you should not have that script open in the script
editor.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><u><i><b><font color="#FF0000">WARNING:</font></b></i></u> You can not just export
files into your modules temp directory and expect the Bioware tools to know
about them.&nbsp; The easiest thing to do is inside of the Bioware tools, create
a blank script with the exact same name, save and then close the script.&nbsp;
Then export to that file using NWN Treasure.</p>
<h4 align="left">Exporting Your Treasure Tables</h4>
<p align="left">In order to be able to use your new treasure tables in your
module, the first must be exported.&nbsp; If you haven't exported the treasure
script to your module before, you must first create a new script in the NWN
toolkit with the name of the file you wish to export.&nbsp; Close the script
editor but keep the NWN toolkit loaded with your module open.&nbsp; Then in the NWN Treasure
program, select the export option.&nbsp; Locate the newly created
script in your &quot;C:NeverwinterNights\NWN\Modules\tempxxx\&quot; directory
and save.&nbsp; (Note: The exact directory name will vary depending on where NWN
was installed.)</p>
<h4 align="left">Using Your Treasure Tables With NPCs</h4>
<p align="left">In order to have your NPCs use your new treasure table, you must
create a new OnSpawn NPC script and assign that script to your NPC.&nbsp; Using
the default NPC OnSpawn script as a starting point, the following changes must
be made.&nbsp; (Remember, save to a different file name)</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Locate the line &quot;#include
    &quot;nw_o2_coninclude&quot;&quot; and replace &quot;nw_o2_coninclude&quot;
    with the name of the script you exported.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Locate the line &quot;GenerateNPCTreasure ()&quot; and
    replace it with a call to the treasure table of your choice.</li>
</ol>
<p align="left">For example:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left">Let us assume you have created a treasure table called &quot;my_phatlewt&quot;.&nbsp;
  In order to generate treasure on a NPC using that table, you would make the
  following call.</p>
  <p align="left">CT_my_phatlewt (OBJECT_SELF, OBJECT_SELF);</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 align="left">Using Your Treasure Tables With Placeables</h4>
<p align="left">In order to have your placeables use your new treasure table,
you must create a new OnOpen and OnClose placeables script and assign this
script to your placeable.&nbsp; In almost all cases, both the OnOpen and OnClose
scripts can be the exact same script.&nbsp; Using on of the default NWN OnOpen
scripts such as &quot;nw_o2_classmed&quot; as a starting point, make the
following changes.&nbsp; (Remember, save to a different file name)</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Locate the line &quot;#include
    &quot;nw_o2_coninclude&quot;&quot; and replace &quot;nw_o2_coninclude&quot;
    with the name of the script you exported.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Locate the line &quot;GenerateXXXTreasure ()&quot; and
    replace it with a call to the treasure table of your choice.</li>
</ol>
<p align="left">For example:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left">Let us assume you have created a treasure table called &quot;my_phatlewt&quot;.&nbsp;
  In order to generate treasure on a placeable using that table, you would make
  the following call.</p>
  <p align="left">CT_my_phatlewt (GetLastOpener (), OBJECT_SELF);</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 align="left">4.2 Using NWN Treasure With Shroudworld Style Respawn</h3>
<p align="left">So, you have decided use all the features available in NWN Treasure.</p>
<p align="left"><u><i><b><font color="#FF0000">WARNING:</font></b></i></u> Under
NO circumstances should you EVER overwrite the scripts contained in NWN's
override directory.&nbsp; Don't do it.&nbsp; JUST DON'T DO IT.</p>

<h4 align="left">Exporting Your Treasure Tables</h4>
<p align="left">In order to be able to use your new treasure tables in your

script in your &quot;C:NeverwinterNights\NWN\Modules\tempxxx\&quot; directory
and save.&nbsp; (Note: The exact directory name will vary depending on where NWN
was installed.)</p>
<p align="left">When exporting for Shroudworld, make sure you select the
&quot;Shroudworld&quot; mode in the export dialog box.</p>
<h4 align="left">Using the Shroudworld Respawn System</h4>
<p align="left">At the time of this writing, all content for Shroudworld will be
combined into a single module.&nbsp; However, since not all content will be
using all the features of the respawner, content providers who use the respawner
won't be able to depend on the NWN default scripts being modified for use with
the respawner.&nbsp; Thus, NPCs and placeables that wish to use the respawner
MUST make new blueprints that use specialized scripts.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">The good news is that only three scripts need to be created; NPC
OnSpawn, NPC OnDeath, and placeable OnOpen/OnClose.</p>
<h4 align="left">Creating a new NPC OnSpawn</h4>
<p align="left">In order to have your NPCs use the respawner, you must
create a new OnSpawn NPC script and assign that script to your NPC blueprints.&nbsp; Using
the default NPC OnSpawn script as a starting point, the following changes must
be made.&nbsp; (Remember, save to a different file name)</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Locate the line &quot;#include
    &quot;nw_o2_coninclude&quot;&quot; and replace &quot;nw_o2_coninclude&quot;
    with &quot;sw_i0_treasure&quot;.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Locate the line &quot;GenerateNPCTreasure ()&quot; and
    replace it with a call to &quot;DoNPCSpawn ();&quot;.</li>
</ol>
<h4 align="left">Creating a new NPC OnDeath</h4>
<p align="left">In order to have your NPCs use the respawner, you must
create a new OnDeath NPC script and assign that script to your NPC blueprints.&nbsp; Using
the default NPC OnDeath script as a starting point, the following changes must
be made.&nbsp; (Remember, save to a different file name)</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Add a new include, &quot;#include
    &quot;sw_i0_treasure&quot;&quot;.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Prior to the &quot;NW_I_AM_DEAD&quot; shout line, add a call
    to &quot;DoNPCDeath ();&quot;</li>
</ol>
<h4 align="left">Creating a new Placeable OnOpen/OnClose</h4>
<p align="left">In order to have your placeables use the respawner, you must
create a new OnOpen/OnClose placeable script and assign that script to your
placeable blueprints.&nbsp; Using
the default placeable OnOpen/OnClose script as a starting point, the following changes must
be made.&nbsp; (Remember, save to a different file name)</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Locate the line &quot;#include
    &quot;nw_o2_coninclude&quot;&quot; and replace &quot;nw_o2_coninclude&quot;
    with &quot;sw_i0_treasure&quot;.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Replace ALL of the code in the main routine, but leave the
    main and surrounding &quot;{}&quot;, with a call to &quot;DoOpenDeath
    ();&quot;</li>
</ol>
<p align="left">If you wish for all your placeables to have a default treasure,
the add the following line prior to the call to &quot;DoOpenDeath&quot;.<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
SetLocalString (OBJECT_SELF, &quot;SW_RS_DEFAULT_PROFILE&quot;, &quot;mytablename&quot;);<br>
<h4 align="left">Using Your Treasure Tables With Placeables</h4>
<p align="left">In order to have your placeables use your new treasure table,
you must create a new OnOpen and OnClose placeables script and assign this
script to your placeable.&nbsp; In almost all cases, both the OnOpen and OnClose
scripts can be the exact same script.&nbsp; Using on of the default NWN OnOpen
scripts such as &quot;nw_o2_classmed&quot; as a starting point, make the
following changes.&nbsp; (Remember, save to a different file name)</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Locate the line &quot;#include
    &quot;nw_o2_coninclude&quot;&quot; and replace &quot;nw_o2_coninclude&quot;
    with the name of the script you exported.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Locate the line &quot;GenerateXXXTreasure ()&quot; and
    replace it with a call to the treasure table of your choice.</li>
</ol>
<p align="left">For example:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left">Let us assume you have created a treasure table called &quot;my_phatlewt&quot;.&nbsp;
  In order to generate treasure on a placeable using that table, you would make
  the following call.</p>
  <p align="left">CT_my_phatlewt (GetLastOpener (), OBJECT_SELF);</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 align="left"> Telling NWN Treasure what script to execute</h4>
<p align="left">In order for NWN Treasure to know what script to execute, you
must assign a local string to each of your areas.&nbsp; Inside the OnModuleLoad,
use the following example to set the treasure script for an area:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left">object oArea = GetObjectByTag (&quot;MY_AREA_NAME&quot;);<br>
  SetLocalString (oArea, &quot;SW_RS_SCRIPT&quot;, &quot;my_treasure&quot;);</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 align="left"> Telling NWN Treasure a default respawn time</h4>
<p align="left">Be default, NWN Treasure will default to a respawn time of 30
seconds.&nbsp; If you wish to change this for an area, then the
local integer &quot;SW_RS_RESPAWN_DEFTIME&quot; must be set to the number of
seconds.&nbsp; This value must be non-zero.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left">object oArea = GetObjectByTag (&quot;MY_AREA_NAME&quot;);<br>
  SetLocalInt (oArea, &quot;SW_RS_RESPAWN_DEFTIME&quot;, 10);</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 align="left">Setting Up Respawn and Treasure on Your NPCs and chests</h4>
<p align="left">By default, treasure will be created the same way that the
original treasure tables make treasure for NPCs and chests.&nbsp; (Unless you
have modified the treasure tables).&nbsp; Containers that use
&quot;nw_o2_classmed&quot; will still generate medium level treasure.&nbsp; NPCs
will still generate low level NPC treasure.</p>
<p align="left">However, respawning the NPCs and containers is a big
issue.&nbsp; All respawned content MUST come from existing blueprints.&nbsp; If
you place an NPC in your module, customize it heavily but do not create a new
blueprint with all the modifications, that NPC will not respawn properly.</p>
<p align="left">Instead of going into great detail about how everything works,
let us look at examples on how to set things up.</p>
<hr size="1">
<h3 align="left">5. How to do Different Things with the Shroudworld Respawn</h3>
<h4 align="left">5.1. I want this NPC/Container I got from the NWN palette to
respawn automatically</h4>
<p align="left">One of the nice things is that for NPCs, all the tag names are
the same as the blueprint names.&nbsp; So, unless the tag name is different than
the blueprint name, you are done.&nbsp; However, this is not the case for
containers.</p>
<p align="left">If the tag name is different, then modify the tag name on the
NPC/Container placed in your module.&nbsp; Set the tag to be the same as the
blueprint name found on the advanced tab.&nbsp; You will NOT need to add this
modified creature/container to your palette.&nbsp; The respawn system will
remember the tag name for future respawns.</p>
<h4 align="left">5.2. I want this NPC/Container I got from the NWN palette to
respawn automatically, but I want to customize it.</h4>
<p align="left">If you want to customize the look of your NPC/Container or add
such things as traps and have them respawn, then you MUST add the new
NPC/Container to the palette.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Place the NPC/Container in your module.&nbsp; Make all the
customizations required.&nbsp; Change the tag to make the name that you will use
for the blueprint name in the palette.&nbsp; Add the NPC/Container to the
palette.&nbsp; Make SURE you set the blueprint name (advanced tab) to match the
name used for the tag.</p>
<h4 align="left">5.3. I want this NPC/Container, but I think the loot sucks.&nbsp;
Can I change it to use a different treasure name?</h4>
<p align="left">Yes.&nbsp; Place the NPC/Container in your module.&nbsp; Edit
the tag name and add at the beginning the name of the treasure table followed by
two underscores.</p>
<p align="left">For example, let us say this is an NPC with the tag and
blueprint of &quot;PHATGUARD&quot;.&nbsp; By default, all NPCs use the &quot;nw_npc_low&quot;
treasure table.&nbsp; If you want this NPC to drop high level loot, then you can
change his tag to &quot;nw_high__PHATGUARD&quot;.&nbsp; The respawn system is
smart enough to see the loot table name at the start and then use the second
part as the blue print name.</p>
<h4 align="left">5.4. I have a blueprint called &quot;MYGUARD&quot; that I use for
my waypoints and posts.&nbsp; I have modified their tag so they use the
waypoints or posts that I want them to.&nbsp; But the respawn system always
gives me badgers.</h4>
<p align="left">The problem is that if you have a blueprint called &quot;MYGUARD&quot;
but have modified all instances of that blueprint with tags such as
&quot;GUARDWPSET1&quot; and &quot;GUARDPOSTA&quot;, the respawn engine doesn't
have a clue what to spawn.&nbsp; Thus the game creates badgers.&nbsp; Why
badgers?&nbsp; I don't know.&nbsp; But that is only half the problem.&nbsp; The
respawn system does have a method of telling it that when it sees a specific tag
to then use what is called a &quot;profile&quot; to determine how to respawn the
NPC.&nbsp; But if this was used in this case, all respawned guards would lose
their specific tags (they would be spawned with the tag from the
blueprint).&nbsp; They would fail to work.</p>
<p align="left">The only way to get around this problem is that for every
waypoint set and every post, a new blueprint must be made with the tag set to
the name of the waypoint set or post and the blueprint name matching that
tag.&nbsp; It really isn't a good solution, but at the moment there is little
that can be done short of replacing the waypoint system.</p>
<h4 align="left">5.5. How do I use a specific treasure table for my NWN
encounters?</h4>
<p align="left">Now we are starting to get into a feature in NWN Treasure called
profiles.&nbsp; This allows the content developer to define treasure tables and
other respawn information for a mob with a given name.</p>
<p align="left">For example, let us assume your encounter spawned mobs with a
tag of &quot;NW_DEER&quot;.&nbsp; Inside of NWN Treasure, create a new profile and
call it &quot;nw_deer&quot;.&nbsp; Leave all fields as default except the
treasure table.&nbsp; Change that setting to what you wish it to be and
save.&nbsp; Export and recompile the script and you are done.</p>
<h4 align="left">5.6. How do I create my own treasure table</h4>
<p align="left">Go into the treasure editor, select &quot;Treasure Tables&quot;
and click on &quot;Insert Table&quot;.&nbsp; Give the table a name such as
&quot;sw_sewer&quot;.&nbsp; Check the global checkbox and give the table a
number.&nbsp; Export and recompile the script.</p>
<p align="left">See #3 for more information on changing the loot table for an
NPC/Container.&nbsp; Or if you need to use a profile, then change the treasure
table setting for the profile to your new treasure table.</p>
<h4 align="left">5.7. How do I have a creature spawn when a treasure chest is open</h4>
<p align="left">This is another example of where you have to use the profiles in
NWN Treasure.&nbsp; Create a new profile give it a name.&nbsp; If you use the same
name as the tag name used by the container's blueprint, then ALL containers
using that blueprint will use this profile.&nbsp; If you just want it for a few
chests, then give the profile a unique name that doesn't match any tag name in
your module.</p>
<p align="left">Next, set the &quot;Death/Open Spawn&quot; setting to the
blueprint of the mod you wish to spawn or the name of an encounter table.&nbsp;
If you want a sound to play, set the name of the sound without the
&quot;.wav&quot;.&nbsp; If you want damage to be dealt, then set a value larger
than 0.</p>
<p align="left">Next, if you will have to change the container's tag to match
the profile name, then you will need to set the respawn blueprint name to the
name of the blueprint used to respawn the container.&nbsp; Export and recompile
the script.</p>
<p align="left">Place the container in your module.&nbsp; If your profile name
doesn't match the tag of the container, then change the tag to the name of the
profile.&nbsp; The respawn system will remember this even after the container
has been respawned and the tag lost.</p>
<h4 align="left">5.8. Can I have a creature spawn when my NPC is killed?</h4>
<p align="left">Yes, follow the exact same steps for question 7.</p>
<h4 align="left">5.9. Can I create a default treasure for the whole area?</h4>
<p align="left">Currently, if you want to create a default treasure for the
whole area, then you MUST use area specific treasure tables (see the
instructions from when you added Shroudworld respawning to your module.)</p>
<p align="left">Next, you will need to create a new profile in NWN Treasure.&nbsp;
Call this profile &quot;*&quot;.&nbsp; That tells the respawn system that this
profile is to be used for all objects that don't have a profile defined.&nbsp;
IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT THIS IS THE LAST PROFILE IN THE LIST.&nbsp; Use the
move down button to move it to the bottom.</p>
<p align="left">In the profile, set the treasure table to the name of the table
you want to use.&nbsp; If you want no treasure to drop, set it to &quot;nw_none&quot;.&nbsp;
Now, this will apply to all NPCs and containers unless they have their own
profile or unless they have a treasure table encoded in their tag such as &quot;nw_high__NW_DEER&quot;.</p>
