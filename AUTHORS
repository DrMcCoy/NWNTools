NWN Tools was originally developped by Edward T. Smith (a.k.a. Torlack). After
being employed by BioWare, he deemed it was no longer appropriate for him to
develop this project as it might violate his contract. In order for the
community to still have access to this work, he contributed the source tree to
the Open Knights Consortium who will now be maintaining it.

As of now, NWN Tools is no longer owned by a single individual, but instead is
a group effort of many individuals. While it may have an assigned maintainer,
anyone is welcomed to join with the Open Knights and to contribute patches to
it.

The following individuals have done major work for NWN Tools and should be
noted:
