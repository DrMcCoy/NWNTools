This is the nwn script compiler originally written by Torlack 
(Edward T. Smith).

It was compiled for the Mac by sumpfork (sumpfork@sourceforge.net)
and bug reports should be made to the Openknights consortium at
http://sf.net/projects/openknights.

This is a command line only tool. It is part of the NWNTools package
by Torlack that is now maintained and distributed by the Openknights
consortium.
