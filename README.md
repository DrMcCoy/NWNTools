NWNTools
========

This is a CVS checkout/conversion of the old [NWNTools module](http://openknights.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/openknights/NWNTools/) by the [OpenKnights consortium](http://sourceforge.net/projects/openknights/), with some commits added to fix compilation on modern systems.

NWNTools is licensed under the terms of the 3-clause BSD License. Please see the [COPYING file](COPYING) for details.

Please note that the tools have to be compiled as 32-bit! When compiled as 64-bit, they will crash in various places, and might even produce garbage (who knows).
