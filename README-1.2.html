    <h3>This Software and Bioware's Intellectual Property
    Rights</h3>

    <p>If you are looking for information about how Bioware renders
    their graphics or information about deep NWN internals, you are
    looking in the wrong place.</p>

    <p>Bioware (or their lawyers) might not agree, but IMHO, none
    of the software contained here exposes any intellectual
    property Bioware might hold.&nbsp; Game companies might not
    mind much about how they store basic model information, but
    when it comes to their rendering engine, they can be very
    protective.&nbsp; Contracts can be won or lost based on the
    performance or looks of a rendering engine.&nbsp; So exposing
    or even discovering intellectual property information is
    something that I avoid at all costs.</p>

    <h3>Non-Windows Ports</h3>

    <p>With the assistance of people lick Erydan and Sumpfork, we
    now have available the tools to build the NWScript compiler for
    non-windows operating systems such as Linux, MacOS, and
    FreeBSD.&nbsp; This work is still in progress but we have made
    a significant step forward.&nbsp; If you run into any problems
    building the compiler on other platforms, please send any code
    corrections to <a href=
    "mailto:torlack@torlack.com">torlack@torlack.com</a>.&nbsp;
    However, please remember that I don't do non-Windows operating
    systems.&nbsp; If you can't get the compiler to compile, I
    can't provide any support.</p>

    <p>Older versions of GCC seem to have problems with inline
    functions.&nbsp; To just avoid this problem all together,
    "<em>AM_CXXFLAGS = -fno-default-inline</em>" has been added to
    the makefiles.&nbsp; This will hurt performance to a
    degree.</p>

    <h3>Credits</h3>

    <p>Initial Linux port of the compiler by Francois Guimond
    a.k.a. Erydan.<br>
     Assistance with automake/autoconf and MacOS/X port by
    Sumpfork</p>

    <h3>About the Source</h3>

    <p>The source is a VC7 (VS.NET) solution file.&nbsp; However,
    all source code for the model compiler should be usable on a
    more standard compiler platform.&nbsp; There are no "stdafx.h"
    or "windows.h" includes excluding the main executable.&nbsp;
    Even there, those includes are "#ifdef" protected and only used
    for registry access.&nbsp; However, that doesn't mean the
    software will build on a GCC system without modification.</p>

    <p>NWN Explorer and NWN Treasure Editor both use ATL and
    WTL.&nbsp; NWN Explorer also uses FMOD from <a href=
    "http://www.fmod.org/">http://www.fmod.org/</a>.&nbsp; NWN
    Script compiler uses the MSTA compiler compiler from the COCOM
    tool set.&nbsp; The package can be downloaded from <a href=
    "http://cocom.sourceforge.net/">http://cocom.sourceforge.net/</a>.</p>

    <p>May C++ purists will have an aneurysm when they see some of
    the code.&nbsp; To those I say, "deal with it."&nbsp; (OMG, HE
    USED A GOTO!!!!!)</p>

    <h3>Revisions</h3>

    <h4>March 12th, 2003:</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>Blank statements after an if or else statement will now
      generate a warning.</li>

      <li>The compiler will automatically ignore requests to
      include the same include file multiple times in a script
      compilation.</li>

      <li>With the non-Windows versions, if the path specified for
      the NWN directory doesn't end in a "/", one will be
      automatically added.</li>

      <li>All the libraries and the model converter have been
      converted to build with GCC.</li>

      <li>Corrected a problem with the script decompiler regarding
      the TALENT type.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>April 23rd, 2003:</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>On GCC systems, the script compiler optimizer might throw
      an assert.&nbsp; The code has been modified to prevent the
      assert which was non-fatal in nature.</li>

      <li>On some GCC systems, the basename routine is declared as
      having a "char *" argument.&nbsp; The only place where this
      caused a problem has been modified to force the type to "char
      *".&nbsp; A future version will have a better fix for this
      problem.</li>

      <li>If a function declaration has more arguments than the
      prototype, the compiler would fail to generate an
      error.&nbsp; This would result in a compiled script that runs
      the risk of generating "STACK UNDERFLOW" errors.</li>

      <li>Corrected a bug in the script compiler that would fail to
      generate an error when a function was called without enough
      parameters.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>July 1st, 2003:</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>Added the new -v command line argument to the script
      compiler.&nbsp; This allows for the compiler to compile files
      using older compiler rules.</li>

      <li>The script compiler now generates the new script debug
      file (NDB).</li>

      <li>A '.' (dot) in the input path which is not part of the
      extension will no longer confuse&nbsp;the model and script
      compiler.</li>

      <li>The default directory for including script includes will
      be the same directory as the input script.</li>

      <li>The script decompiler now supports the new NOP
      opcode.</li>

      <li>Corrected a script compiler crash caused by some types of
      syntax errors.</li>

      <li>Increased the maximum size of a compiled script to 512k
      to match BioWare maximum script size.</li>

      <li>Added support for SoU key files.</li>
    </ul>
